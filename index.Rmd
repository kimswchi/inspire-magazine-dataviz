title: "About This Project"

This website is a final project for [MACS 40700/Data Visualization (Spring 2017)](https://github.com/uc-cfss/dataviz) at the University of Chicago.

## Purpose

This website serves as an interactive visual exploration of various aspects of *Inspire*, an online English-language magazine produced by al-Qaeda's affiliate al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The specific questions that I address in this visualization are:

* What categories and topics do the magazine cover and how does the coverage vary across issues? 
* Who are the main contributors to the magazine? 
* How much of the magazine's content is original? In other words, what proportion of articles are written specifically for *Inspire* and what proportion are drawn from other sources?

The answers to these questions hold practical implications for counter-terrorism efforts, but the visualization also provides an accessible and relatively non-alarmist peek into terrorist messaging for all members of the public.

## Design concept

Throughout the visualization, I employ a theme of "illuminating" - that is, shedding light on the issue at hand, and also rejecting terror itself. Thus, instead of accomodating the obscurity and darkness of the subject matter, I provide a contrast with a bright white background and luminescent hues.
