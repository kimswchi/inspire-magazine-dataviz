Abdulmutallab was<br />popularly referred to in the media as the ''Underwear Bomber''.<br /><br />Abdulmutallab, though unsuccessful in his attempt, was praised as a ''heroic martyrdom bomber''<br />in the first issue of <Inspire>. In this issue, AQAP also claimed to have developed an ''advanced<br />bomb'' capable of passing through airport security systems undetected, which supposedly enabled<br />Abdulmutallab to board the plane. Only a ''technical glitch'' prevented the bomb from exploding co-<br />mpletely, they said."
