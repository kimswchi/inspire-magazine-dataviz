# Inspire Illuminated: An Interactive Visualization of a Terrorist Magazine

This project visualizes various aspects of *Inspire*, an online English-language magazine produced by al-Qaeda affiliate al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

The current version of the visualization is hosted [here](https://kimswchi.github.io/inspire-magazine-dataviz/).

The packages used for the project are listed in `package_versions.md`.

#### Note:
I don't know why there is a large blank space after every plotly graph. I edited the HTML source code and the html files when opened do not show the blank spaces. They only show up on the website.
