> ...And inspire the believers

*Inspire* is an online English-language magazine published by one of al-Qaeda's main franchises, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). AQAP operates primarily in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, but has drawn attention for various terrorist plots against Western targets. Since their founding in 2009, they have carried out numerous deadly attacks, attempted assassinations, conquered territory in Yemen, and incited violence abroad with *Inspire* and other propaganda outlets. Notably, the group made credible claims to have trained and directed the two attackers of the 2015 shooting at headquarters of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris.

AQAP published the first issue of *Inspire* in July 2010, and as of mid-2017 there are 16 issues, the most recent published in November 2016. A principal aim of *Inspire* is to recruit and mobilize co-conspirators from English-speaking countries, and to encourage them to carry out attacks domestically as well as to join their militia in the Middle East. *Inspire* famously dedicates a section of each issue to a concept they call "Open Source Jihad", or detailed how-to-guides for conducting domestic terrorist attacks. In fact, the Boston marathon bombers are believed to have used one of these guides to build the bombs used in their attack [1][2].

The following table presents information on each issue, including the release date and number of pages.

```{r about_table}
pubtable <- hist %>%
  select(Issue, CoverStory, ReleaseDate, TotalPages) %>%
  transform(ReleaseDate = as.character(ReleaseDate)) %>%
  transform(ReleaseDate = as.Date(ReleaseDate, "%m/%d/%Y")) %>%
  mutate(ReleaseYear = as.character(year(ReleaseDate))) %>%
  mutate(ReleaseMonth = as.character(month.abb[month(ReleaseDate)])) %>%
  transform(ReleaseDate = paste(ReleaseMonth, ReleaseYear)) %>%
  select(-ReleaseYear, -ReleaseMonth) %>%
  transform(CoverStory = as.character(CoverStory)) %>%
  transform(CoverStory = ifelse(Issue == 3, "$4,200", CoverStory))
